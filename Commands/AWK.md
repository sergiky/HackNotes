A text process utility

# Print all
With $0 you print all the content that you passed

````bash
awk '{print $0}'
````

or

````bash
awk '{print}'
````

----

# Take the first column or second or...

Remember by default the separator is an space

````bash
awk '{print $1}'
````

````bash
awk '{print $2}'
````

----

# Change the delimiter

Remember that by default the delimiter is a space

## BEGIN AND FS

With begin are indicate that the **File Separator** is ":", **before processing the file**

````bash
cat /etc/passwd | awk 'BEGIN {FS=":"} {print $1 " " $2}'
````

## -F delimiter while processing

````bash
awk -F ":" '{print $1}' /etc/passwd

awk -F : '{print $1}' /etc/passwd

awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd

````

or something like this:

````bash
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F ":" '{print  $1}'
````


---

# Print many columns

This put all the text together and don't add spaces to the columns to print

````bash
awk -F ":" '{print $1 $6 $7}' /etc/passwd
````

````bash
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F ":" '{print $1 $6 $7}'
````

## Add characters between columns

```bash
awk -F ":" '{print $1 " " $6 " " $7 " generated by chatGPT"}' /etc/passwd
```

You can add  `\t, \n ...`

````bash
awk -F ":" '{print $1 "\n" $6 "\t" $7 " generated by chatGPT"}' /etc/passwd
````

---

# Change the delimiter and put in the output

Remember if you the comma ( , ) in the output they include a space
````bash
awk 'BEGIN{FS=":"; OFS="----"} {print $1,$6,$7}' /etc/passwd
````

````bash
cat /etc/passwd | awk 'BEGIN {FS=":"; OFS="----"} {print $1,$6,$7}'
````

FS: **File Separator**. Indicate that the file separator is : 
OFS: **Output File Separator**. You can change it, if you look the OFS is represent with the ( , )

----

# Take the last argument

To take the last argument or column you can use **$NF** (Number of Fields) 

````bash
 awk -F ":" '{print $NF}' /etc/passwd
````

---

# Pattern

To do a pattern in awk you have to use /pattern/, like this example:

````bash
awk -F "/" '/ / {print $NF}' /etc/shells
````

In this awk you are indicating three things:

````bash
awk -F "/" '/^\// {print $NF}' /etc/shells
````

1. The field separator is an slash
2. Indicate a pattern that say "take all that **begin** with an slash"
3. Print the last field

---

# Mathematical operations

````bash
awk '{print $1 + $2}' test.txt
awk '{print $1 - $2}' test.txt
awk '{print $1 * $2}' test.txt
awk '{print $1 / $2}' test.txt
````

----

# Using the length function

## Taking the lines that are greater than...

````bash
awk 'length($0) > 12' /etc/shells
````

----

# Remember

You can combine with other commands... [[General commands]]
